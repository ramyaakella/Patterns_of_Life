# Patterns_of_Life

"Patterns of Life" is a visual analytics project that explores daily routines and travel patterns in Ohio. By analyzing volunteer data as a representative sample, this study identifies distinct urban areas,  
highlights traffic congestion points, examines individual daily routines, and observes temporal changes in urban dynamics.

## Project Description
This project utilizes visual analytics to uncover urban patterns related to daily activities, traffic flow, and economic trends. Through interactive and color-coded visual representations, the study provides
insights into population distribution, commuting behavior, and financial spending habits. The methodology employs D3.js and geo-spatial parsing to create a dynamic and accessible urban analysis.

There are 4 distinct task that the visualizations achieve:
- Characterizing Distinct Areas of the City 
- Identifying Busiest Areas and Traffic Bottlenecks 
- Routine Comparison 
- Representation of the changes 


## Technologies Used
- D3.js for interactive visualizations
- GeoParsing & Spatial Analysis for mapping movements
- JavaScript & JSON for data handling
- Python & Pandas for preprocessing and analysis
